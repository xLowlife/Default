/******************************************************************************
Business Program for Customer Data that is Not a Game

Donnie Gilbert
CS162-W1 SP24 Priestley


Purpose of the program:
Make a Program to search for Clients in an Array for weekly homework.
A lot of this code is a continuation of the game from Week 3 of CS162-W1 SP24.
I am mostly just using this as an opportunity to seek feedback on the progress of
its' development so that I may further my desire of working on the game from week 3.
Currently, this program only demonstrates the Game's Menu/Ui functions, the Data Filling
functions, and the Level Building, Player Character Generating functions.
The Fighting functions are functional, but not ready for demonstration.


Specification Summary:
Define a struct to store a customer record in a file.
	- (ID, company name, city, state, customer type)
Populate an array of clients with at least three clients' information.
	- (can be hard-coded or retrieved from a file, your choice)
Allow the user to type a client ID and see all the corresponding customer data.
	- Your program searches the array for the ID entered by the user.
You are encouraged to store the information on disk,
either in a sequential or random-access file, but that is optional this week.


Notes:
I wish I could also display the "Business" and "Employee" data, but I have
already run out of time. It is currently 1:01 AM, and this assignment was due
about an hour ago at 11:59AM. Sorry for any sloppy code, or poor implentations.
I am currently devoting all of my time in to furthering the game, even if it
may be costing me grade wise unfortunately. I've just never had a project I've
enjoyed this much before, and I apologize in advance to you and myself I suppose.
There are a lot of left over functions from my game, but all of the irrelevant
function calls have been removed. I wouldn't suggest trying to call any
function the I have explicitly called in this demonstration, but feel
free to look. ...and technically I know, I'm not actually searching an array,
but theres no way you would think that should be difficult for me to implement.
